The Hackerati JavaScript Exercise
=================================

Using only **raw JavaScript**, create a `Calendar` class that renders a calendar with the following requirements:
- User can change months with the arrow icons and keyboard keys
- The current day is highlighted on calendar
- By default, the current day is shown in the left pane
- On click, the left pane should update with the clicked date
- It should appear similar to the wireframe version (it doesn't need to be perfect)
- **Styling is not a requirement.** Styling is optional if you regard HTML/CSS as one of your strengths
- We ask that you post your submission online with a **live link** (no zips, please)
